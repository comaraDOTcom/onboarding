## Onboarding script
This is a script (.sh) to  make life easier when onboarding and setting up your environment.

Once downloaded/cloned run the following commands (script is already executable so no need to run the first command).

 
`./analyst_onboarding_script.zsh`

If that doesn't work, you may need to run the following instead:
```zsh
chmod +x analyst_onboarding_script.zsh
./analyst_onboarding_script.zsh
```

Inspired by Gitlab's [script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/admin/onboarding_script.zsh)
