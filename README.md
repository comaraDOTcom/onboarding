## Onboarding script
This is a script (.sh) to  make life easier when onboarding and setting up your environment.

Once downloaded/cloned run the following commands.

`chmod +x analyst_onboarding_script.zsh`  
`./analyst_onboarding_script.zsh`

Inspired by Gitlab's [script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/admin/onboarding_script.zsh)
